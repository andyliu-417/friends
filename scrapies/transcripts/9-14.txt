[Scene: 
  Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is in the kitchen as Joey enters from his 
  bedroom.]
 
Joey: Morning, roomie!
 
Rachel: Hey! You remembered to put clothes 
  on this morning.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Fifth day's a charm.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Rachel: Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back 
  here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Hey, it's great having you back. You 
  know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
(Ross 
  enters.)

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Ross: Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, 
  when will we expect to see you tonight?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Rachel: Well, I'll probably be back to pick 
  her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually 
  fall back to sleep, so...

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: She's probably exhausted from all 
  that adorable screaming she did last night.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Rachel: Bye!

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
(She 
  leaves.)

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Ross: Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making 
  it too hard on you.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: No, hey, it's been great.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Ross: Yeah?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Yeah. And look, I just want you to 
  know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before 
  are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk 
  in on a woman using a breast pump...

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Ross: Yeah, that'll do it.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Wow! So, how are you?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Ross: I'm, I'm okay. 

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Really?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Ross: Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel 
  living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, 
  but it's not like it's a divorce.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Well, actually it...

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Ross: No, it's not a divorce, it is not 
  a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, 
  maybe, maybe start seeing other people.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Wow, really?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Ross: Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you 
  know anyone that would be good for me...

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Sure, I know lots of girls. 

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Ross: Yeah? Any names come to mind?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Ooh, names?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>

[Scene: 
  Joey and Rachel's apartment. Joey is there as Phoebe enters.]

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: Hey.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Hey. I was just gonna get something 
  to eat. You want something?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: What you got?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey 
  (checks the refrigerator): Okay, let's 
  see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't 
  tried that yet.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living 
  with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's 
  just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked 
  me to fix him up with somebody.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew 
  anyone for her too.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Why are they doing this?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: I don't know. They're so perfect for 
  each other; it's crazy.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: You know what's crazy? These jars. 
  What is it, like two bites in here?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: I just wish they'd realise they should 
  be together.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: I know, I know. And when they moved 
  back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: I know. They should be a family. They 
  should get married and have more children.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Yes, and they should name one of their 
  kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: You know what? Maybe once they start 
  dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for 
  each other.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Yeah, because it is slim pickings. 
  I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's 
  still in the bedroom.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: So, what are we gonna do? Are we just 
  gonna go ahead and set them up with people?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: I know; that just pushes them further 
  and further apart. 

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: Yeah. (BEAT) Oh, I know what we can 
  do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise 
  how good they are together.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Ooh, that's a great plan! 

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: Yeah, you know what the best part 
  of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh." (A maniacal laugh follows.)

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
(They 
  both start laughing really loudly.)

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna 
  wake up, uh...

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
(He 
  looks at his bedroom door, but he can't remember the name of the girl.)

[Scene: 
  Monica and Chandler's apartment. They're in the kitchen as Rachel enters.]

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Rachel: Hey!

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Hey!

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Rachel: You guys aren't doing anything tonight, 
  are you?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: See, now, why would you assume that? 
  Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening 
  people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Rachel: I was just asking 'cause I need someone 
  to watch Emma tonight.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Sure, we'll do that. What are you 
  up to?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Rachel: Well, Phoebe set me up on a date. 
  

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Oh my god.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: Wow.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Rachel: Why? What's the big deal?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Just figured, 'cause you and Ross 
  are...

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Rachel: What, slept together a year and a 
  half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: Well, I think it's great that you're 
  going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. 
  Embrace your womanhood!

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," 
  and send out a resume!

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Rachel: So I'll bring her by around seven? 
  Is that okay?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Oh, it's perfect.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Rachel: Oh, you guys are gonna have so much 
  fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid 
  food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes 
  to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she 
  screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler (reading the newspaper): Suddenly 
  I wish I was reading my own name.

[Scene: 
  Central Perk. Joey is drinking coffee by the counter as Phoebe enters.]

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: Ooh, Joey. 

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Hey.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up 
  Rachel with the worst guy tonight. 

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: All right! Who is he?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: Well, it's this guy I used to massage. 
  And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey (gives a thumbs up sign): Okay, okay. 
  Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: Oh, yeah.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
(They 
  sit down on the couch.)

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: She's this really boring woman. She's 
  a teacher! 

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: A teacher?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Yeah, yeah, she's really into history 
  and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves 
  puzzles?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: Well, Ross does. What... You're - 
  you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect 
  woman! 

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Oh my god, you're right! 

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: Yeah.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: She even reads for pleasure!

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: How do you even know a woman like 
  that?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: What? I'm not allowed to know smart 
  women? 

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: Joey.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: I met her at the library. I went in 
  to pee.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: So now what do we do?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call 
  her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: What if we don't find him somebody 
  else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes 
  to the restaurant and gets stood up!

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Ooh...I hear that's bad. 

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna 
  have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good 
  they have it together.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly 
  again, but he sounds more like Santa Claus.)

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: It's not Santa's plan. No, it's... 
  (Laughs the real "plan-laugh.")

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
(They 
  both start laughing again.)

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Joey: Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Phoebe: No, I think we killed it.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>

[Scene: 
  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Emma is there in her playpen, while Chandler 
  is behind the couch.]

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think 
  I'll go downstairs for a while.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
(He 
  does the ancient trick of going downstairs while behind the couch. As soon as 
  he's out of sight, Emma starts crying.)

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's 
  okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; 
  funny is all I have!

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
(Monica 
  enters from their bedroom with a calendar.)

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna 
  be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 
  48 hours.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: I don't do that.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
(Monica 
  looks at him.)

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say 
  until the sixth?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Yeah.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: Today is the sixth.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: No, it's not.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
(Points 
  at the calendar.)

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: Yes, it's also 2003.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may 
  be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the 
  restaurant.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: It's okay. Go take the test and see 
  if we're okay.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Okay.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
(She 
  runs to the bathroom, while Chandler starts acting like a chicken in front of 
  Emma. Emma is silent, however.)

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: Tough crib.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? 
  There's only one here.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: I might have checked to see if I was 
  ovulating a couple times.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Chandler!

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: I am not working. There's not much 
  to do around here!

[Scene: 
  Delmonico's restaurant. Ross is waiting for his blind date to show up. A waiter 
  walks past him.]

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Ross: Excuse me, is there a woman waiting 
  at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Waiter: Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Ross: Well, if I'm still here in an hour, 
  buy him a drink on me.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Waiter: Can I get you another glass of wine? 
  

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Ross: Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't 
  wanna be drunk when I go home alone.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Waiter: Got stood up, huh?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Ross: Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just 
  a blind date.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Waiter: Are you worried your date came, saw 
  you, and left?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Ross: No!

Monica: We're okay. I'm still ovulating.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: Oh, good, because as of four o'clock 
  this afternoon, I am not. 

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: So, let's do this.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: I - I don't think I can.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Come on. I know you're not eighteen 
  anymore, but give it a minute.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: Because of Emma.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot 
  you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: Sorry.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, 
  how much can she even be aware of at this age?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: Well, she's aware when we leave the 
  room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: Canoodling?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: Well, I can't say "hump" 
  or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: I don't know. I mean, I guess having 
  sex in front of a baby isn't so...

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: Horrifying? Scarring? Something people 
  go to jail for?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: I guess you're right.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Chandler: You guess I'm right? When we stayed 
  at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought 
  a deer was staring through the window.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Monica: But what kind of a sick bastard wants 
  to do it in front of a deer?

  I'm gonna have the chicken.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Steve (staring at Rachel): I - I just have 
  to say this; you're really beautiful.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Rachel: Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. 
  Thank you.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Steve: I'm kind of funny looking. 

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Rachel: What?

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Steve: Oh, come on, you're way out of my 
  league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, 
  "ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich!" Well, I'm not! 

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
   
  <![endif]>
  
Rachel (feeling awkward): So, what do think 
  you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.

  <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
